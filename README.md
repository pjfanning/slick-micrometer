# slick-micrometer

Demonstrates a [forked version of metrics-sql](https://github.com/pjfanning/metrics-sql) that uses [micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) to record the metrics instead of dropwizard metrics.
[Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.0/) is used as the the ORM.
The Prometheus Meter Registry is used in the demo.

https://github.com/pjfanning/slick-monitoring uses the normal version of metrics-sql.
